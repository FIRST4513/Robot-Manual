# Robot-Manual
A manual for developing software for FRC robots with the 4513 structure.

This is in OpenOffice Writer format for now. This format was chosen for its openness and its ability to handle the different elements used in this document.

A .pdf verion is included for downloading or printing.
The past .pdf versions are available by looking at the history of the files/robot-manual.pdf file. Direct rendering in the browser does not work on all browsers. Download seems to work everywhere.
The current .pdf version can also be accessed through https://FIRST4513.github.io.

This version is still a draft. It has not been thoroughly proof read and has a section of partially completed articles.

Comments, suggestions, typograpical errors, technical errors, etc. may be posted as an issue.  A project tracks issues to be included in future releases.
